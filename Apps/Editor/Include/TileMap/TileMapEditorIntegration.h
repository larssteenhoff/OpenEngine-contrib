 * @brief Owns the tilemap authoring state and wires the surfaces that share it:
 * the palette and tile set editor, and the Scene View paint tool.
 *
 * The application creates one of these and hands it the services it pulls;
 * nothing tilemap-specific lives in the application after that. It also keeps
 * the edit context's paint target in step with the scene selection: selecting
 * an entity that draws a tile layer targets that layer, selecting anything
 * else clears the target. A palette row click retargets within the same
 * selection and stands until the selection moves again. It also adds the
 * Assets panel's "Import as Tilemap" item for Tiled and LDtk source files.
