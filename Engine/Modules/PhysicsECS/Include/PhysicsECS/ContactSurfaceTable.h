 * `Physics` resolves materials by opaque index and never sees a GUID or a file;
 * this is the layer that closes that gap, because PhysicsECS is where assets and
 * physics are allowed to meet. Index 0 is reserved for "no authored material" —
 * a contact where neither side carries one keeps the friction and restitution
 * the backend combined from the bodies, so installing the predicate does not
 * silently retune every existing collider in the engine.
 *
 * THREADING — the same contract the backend's per-body side table holds to.
 * PhysicsInit grows the table before PhysicsStep. Additional systems that
 * resolve materials must declare dependencies separating their writes from
 * each other and from PhysicsStep. Physics workers read the table during Step;
 * DrainPendingReloads runs at the head of PhysicsStep, before those reads. A
 * reload overwrites its slot in place. Only ResolveMaterial and AddMaterial
 * append slots, and they run outside PhysicsStep (in PhysicsInit or a system
 * ordered apart from it). Indices already baked into bodies stay valid.
