// Colour-keyed text coverage correction: the blend Chrome draws text with on
// macOS, carried into whatever space the attachment blends in.
//
// Glyph coverage out of the Slug rasteriser is the exact area of the dilated
// outline (slug_functions.glsl). What remains is how that coverage becomes a
// blend weight, split into two independent terms.
//
// 1. Contrast, keyed on the paint colour. Chrome 155 on macOS 15.7 (headless,
//    DPR 1 and 2, measured on straight Roboto stems from 8 to 45 px) blends
//    text as an sRGB-ENCODED source-over whose weight is
//        a = c + k c (1 - c)
//    (Skia's apply_contrast shape), with k set by the paint's encoded
//    luminance in four levels: the measured fit is
//    kTextContrastByLuminance below, from slightly thinning near-black text
//    to a strong bulge for near-white text. Light text on a dark ground is
//    the heavy polarity there, the reverse of Skia's own
//    contrast * linDst keying, and the four levels are Chrome's: the
//    background never enters (white on #404040 measured identical to white on
//    black). `contrast` scales k; 1 is Chrome, 0 is plain coverage.
//
//    Those levels apply at the ENCODED target only (blendGamma above the
//    linear sentinel), the space they were measured in: the editor's text.
//    At the linear target (every HUD and Player label) k stays Skia's
//    dst-keyed boost, k = linear level of the guessed backdrop (1 - src), so
//    game text keeps its weight.
//
// 2. Blend-space retarget, bidirectional. An attachment interpolates either
//    LINEAR values (a linear intermediate; the terminal encode owns the OETF)
//    or raw sRGB-ENCODED bytes (the browser blend model: source-over on UNORM
//    bytes holding encoded values). The retarget solves, per fragment, for the
//    coverage whose blend in the attachment's ACTUAL space (blendSpaceEncoded)
//    lands where a blend in the TARGET space (blendGamma) would have put it:
//
//      linear  attachment, linear  target  ->  identity
//      linear  attachment, encoded target  ->  the encoded-blend look out of
//                                              a linear compositor
//      encoded attachment, linear  target  ->  the pre-distortion that makes
//                                              an encoded source-over land
//                                              area-exact
//      encoded attachment, encoded target  ->  identity, by the same maths
//
//    The term 1 weight is an encoded-blend weight. The editor targets the
//    encoded space (blendGamma 1.0) on its EncodedSrgb attachment, where the
//    retarget is the identity and the result is Chrome's. A UIManager's
//    default is the linear target, the identity on a linear attachment. The
//    retarget guesses the destination as the paint's perceptual inverse
//    (dst = 1 - src), which is what lets it run without a framebuffer read.
//
// Both terms are keyed on the glyph's colour and never on ppem: identical
// glyph shapes must not gain or lose ink for having been asked for at a
// different size (the size-keyed part of Chrome's look is the dilation).
